# Memory Game Project
This is the second project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  Udacity provides a starter project containing a static, non-interactive version of the game, found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game), however I chose to build this project from scratch.  The focus of this project was on Javascript mastery, as well as HTML and CSS.

Play a demo game [here](https://codepen.io/PuraVida717/full/wjONLz/)

## Instructions
Each turn consists of flipping over 2 cards by clicking on them to reveal the card images.  The goal is to match cards on each turn.

Matching cards will be removed from the gameboard, and incorrect guesses will be flipped back over.

A timer will begin once the first card is clicked and will end once all cards are matched.

The displayed star rating decreases to 2 stars after 4 incorrect guesses, and 1 star after 10 incorrect guesses.
